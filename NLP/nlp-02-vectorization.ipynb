    "\n",
    "ML models like SVM or Naive Bayes **can’t read text**.\n",
    "They work with **numbers only**.\n",
    "\n",
    "TF-IDF turns documents into vectors like:\n",

    "```\n",
    "Doc1 → [0.0, 0.116, 0.0, 0.0, 0.116, 0.0, 0.0]\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, the model learns:\n",
    "\n",
    "* If the word \"cat\" has a high value → maybe it’s about animals.\n",
    "* If the word \"log\" appears → maybe it’s about wood or tech.\n",
    "\n",
    "Over many documents, the model finds patterns:\n",
    "**“When TF-IDF of ‘cat’ is high → classify as animal-related.”**\n",

    "### ✅ 3. **Find Important Words (Keyword Extraction)**\n",
    "\n",
    "Words with the **highest TF-IDF scores** are often the **most meaningful** in a doc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",

    "- For each query, we're scanning through our entire corpus, but in practice, you'll want to create an **inverted index**. Search applications such as Elasticsearch do that under the hood.\n",
    "- You'd also want to evaluate the efficacy of your search using metrics like **precision** and **recall**.\n",
    "- Document ranking also tends to be more sophisticated, using different ranking functions like Okapi BM25. With major search engines, ranking also involves hundreds of variables such as what the user searched for previously, what do they tend to click on, where are they physically, and on and on. These variables are part of the \"secret sauce\" and are closely guarded by companies.\n",
