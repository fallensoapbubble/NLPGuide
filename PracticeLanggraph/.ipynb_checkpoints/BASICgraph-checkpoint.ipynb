    "## 🧠 What is LangGraph?\n",
    "\n",
    "**LangGraph** is a Python library for building **stateful, multi-agent applications** powered by **graphs**. It's built on top of **LangChain**, and is great for modeling complex AI workflows where agents or tools need to talk to each other in a controlled sequence or loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ✅ Key Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Graph-based Structure**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * You define nodes (functions or chains) and how they connect.\n",
    "   * Think of it as a flowchart of how data moves.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Stateful Execution**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Each step can update or access a shared `state` (like memory).\n",
    "   * Useful for conversations or workflows needing memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Multi-Agent Workflows**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Supports building systems where multiple LLM agents collaborate.\n",
    "   * Example: One agent writes, another reviews, another executes code.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Deterministic Paths**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * You control what node runs next based on output.\n",
    "   * Like an `if/else` condition in a flow.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Built-in Integration with LangChain Tools**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * You can use tools like retrieval, chains, and agents inside LangGraph nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Supports Async Execution**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Efficient for running tasks like API calls or LLMs in parallel.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🧠 Real-World Use Case: Document Review Bot\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example Steps:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Node A: Extract key points from document\n",
    "2. Node B: Summarize\n",
    "3. Node C: Send to reviewer\n",
    "4. Loop until approved\n",
    "\n",
    "**LangGraph lets you:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Handle conditional loops (e.g., review not approved → go back)\n",
    "* Maintain state (e.g., track number of revisions)\n",
    "* Use multiple agents for specialized tasks\n",

    "\r\n",
    "1.  **Shared State (`SupportState`):**\r\n",
    "    * Think of `SupportState` as a central blackboard where all nodes can read and write information. It holds critical details like the `issue`, whether it's `resolved`, the `department` it's routed to, and the `history` of the conversation.\r\n",
    "    * Each node receives the current `SupportState`, performs its logic, and then **returns an updated `SupportState`**. This updated state is then passed to the next node in the graph.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "2.  **Nodes as Functions:**\r\n",
    "    * Each function (`receptionist_node`, `supervisor_node`, `technical_advisor`, etc.) represents a specific step or agent in your customer support process.\r\n",
    "    * **Why `return state`?** When a node finishes its work, it needs to hand over the *modified* state to the graph. By returning `state`, you're essentially saying, \"Here's the current snapshot of our conversation and its status after my part is done. Pass this on to whoever is next.\" If you didn't return the state, the changes made within the node would be lost, and the next node would receive an outdated state.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "3.  **Edges and Conditional Transitions:**\r\n",
    "    * **Edges** define the paths between nodes. They dictate which node comes next.\r\n",
    "    * `builder.add_node(\"receptionist\", receptionist_node)`: This simply registers your Python function `receptionist_node` with the name \"receptionist\" in the graph.\r\n",
    "    * `builder.set_entry_point(\"receptionist\")`: This tells the graph where to start when `graph.invoke()` is called.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "    * **`add_conditional_edges` and `lambda`:** This is where the dynamic routing happens, and `lambda` functions are key.\r\n",
    "        * `builder.add_conditional_edges(\"receptionist\", lambda state: END if state[\"resolved\"] else \"supervisor\")`\r\n",
    "        * When the \"receptionist\" node finishes, `langgraph` calls the `lambda` function provided here.\r\n",
    "        * The **`lambda state: ...`** is a small, anonymous function that takes the `state` (the `SupportState` returned by `receptionist_node`) as input.\r\n",
    "        * It then evaluates the condition: `state[\"resolved\"]`.\r\n",
    "            * If `state[\"resolved\"]` is `True`, the `lambda` function returns `END`, signifying the end of the graph execution.\r\n",
    "            * If `state[\"resolved\"]` is `False`, the `lambda` function returns `\"supervisor\"`, instructing the graph to transition to the \"supervisor\" node next.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "        * Similarly, for the `supervisor` node:\r\n",
    "            * `builder.add_conditional_edges(\"supervisor\", lambda state: state[\"department\"])`\r\n",
    "            * After the `supervisor_node` updates the `state` with the `department`, this `lambda` function simply returns the value of `state[\"department\"]` (e.g., \"technical\", \"financial\", or \"miscellaneous\"). `langgraph` then uses this returned string to find and execute the corresponding node (e.g., \"technical\" routes to `technical_advisor`).\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "        * And for the advisor nodes:\r\n",
    "            * `builder.add_conditional_edges(\"technical\", lambda state: END if state[\"resolved\"] else \"technical\")`\r\n",
    "            * After the `technical_advisor` node executes, this `lambda` checks `state[\"resolved\"]`. If `True`, the flow ends. If `False`, it returns `\"technical\"`, effectively creating a **loop** where the flow goes back to the `technical_advisor` node again for further interaction until the issue is resolved.\r\n",

    "* **`lambda` functions in `add_conditional_edges`:** These are lightweight, inline functions that `langgraph` executes *after* a node finishes. They use the `state` returned by the just-completed node to dynamically decide which path (which next node, or `END`) the graph should take. They are powerful for implementing conditional logic and loops in your graph.\r\n",
